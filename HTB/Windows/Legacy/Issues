Pip issue

1. Check pip
2. pip show impacket
3. if pip impacket shows python3 path then you have to get a fresh machine. But maybe try next steps first and check on old one)but I doubt)

4. https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/
4a. Follow first 2 commands in the above link.
5. pip install pycryptodome

That's all.
